														<h3>The Process</h3>
															<p>
																The process begins with mapping between concepts and usability and user experience goals. From the results of the mapping then made preliminary design which is a rough idea of the website design that will be made. Followed by making low fidelity prototype and high fidelity prototype. We design high-fidelity prototypes using Photoshop to create the interface and Marvelapp to make the interaction between pages.
																<br><br>
																The next process is to perform usability testing directly to users and get feedback from them for further revisions to the creation of the final design.

														<h3>What I Learned</h3>
														<p>This project is the assignment for Human-Computer Interaction course. This is my first project where i learned about usability goal and user experience. By doing this project, I learned how to solve existing problems by paying attention to usability and user experience, gather data from users, and developing prototype.</p>

																	Noskip is a concept of an idea about integrated agenda. The idea comes from our disquiet about the number of people who often forget their appointments. This is often because they are too lazy to write an agenda on their calendars. Based on that story, we design an integrated application that is capable of adding an agenda with ease.
																</p>
																<p>
																	When you create an agenda in Noskip, the application will automatically generate a code that can be distributed to anyone who wants to add the agenda. This simple step allows users to add agenda and remind others.

																	A few days ago I was challenged to revamp the UX of Tokopedia mobile apps on iOS platform. Fortunately, I accepted the challenge with no doubt. Although the processing time limit is short, I managed to apply UX design stages as follows:
																</p>
															</div>
														</div>

														<div class="proses">
															<h3>How Was The Process?</h3>
															<p>
																Since the time given was really short, I only did one iteration of the process of this challenge. Nonetheless, it does not mean the solution offered is not the best solution because I had done every process in depth and sincerely.
															</p>
															<img src="img/projects/tokopedia-proses.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="proses"><br>
															<p>
																This process started with the product definition including defining user needs, persona, and defining usability goal. Then I did the research that includes research on the current state of the Tokopedia app, competitor analysis to know the condition of Tokopedia's competitor, and literature research.
																<br><br>
																after that, I did the analysis according to the research. This analysis will produce pain point and opportunities offered to solve the paint point. The final process was design the wireframe of the solution.
															</p>
														</div>

														<div class="product-definition">
															<h4>Product Defition</h4>
															<p>User Needs</p>
															<p>
																There are several user needs to be fulfilled on this project: </p>
																<ul>
																	<li>Accessing cart page (keranjang) from any pages.</li>
																	<li>Conducting transactions without creating any account.</li>
																	<li>Comparin two items.</li>
																</ul>
															<p>The main proposed of user needs are to make them purchase more through this app.

															</p>
															<p>Persona</p>
															<p>
																There are 4 personas used in this project.
															</p>
															<img src="img/projects/tokopedia-persona.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="persona"><br>

															<p>Usability Goal</p>
															<ul>
																<li>Effective : The app should arouse the user wishes to purchase the items.</li>
																<li>Useful : This app should help user who confuce to choose the items.</li>
																<li>Enjoyable : Users should feel comfortable when using this app without consider about time</li>
																<li>Satisfying : This application must meet user expectations.</li>
															</ul>
														</div>

														<div class="research">
															<h4>Research</h4>
															<p>
																After the product definition stage, I had to understand what users need and get ideas related to it. Then I can look for literature to support the idea and how well it's been implemented elsewhere. So that I can make projections about my ideas.
																<br><br>
																After that, I did a competitive analysis by comparing the ideas that I want to run with existing solutions. I compared the strong and weakness of each solution. Then, take the advantages of the ideas that will be run compared to existing solutions.
															</p>
														</div>

														<div class="analysis">
															<h4>Analysis</h4>
															<p>From the results of research and product definition, managed to created the user journey which includes the pain point for any actions or stages in the use of the existing app. In addition it also offered opportunities to improve existing pain points.</p>
															<img src="img/projects/tokopedia-user_journey.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
															<p>based on the opportunities offered, I decided to apply some of the ideas of this opportunity into the existing app. These additions include:</p>
															<ol>
																<li>Laying the cart page icon on every page so that it can be accessed easily</li>
																<li>Allowing to make a purchase without making an account.</li>
																<li>Account page given additional information about the advantages when users create an account.</li>
																<li>Adding a feature to compare two items.</li>
																<li>Adding an undo button when a user deletes an item in the cart.</li>
																<li>Displaying the rating in search results for each product so that users are more interested in choosing a product.</li>
																<li>Providing suggestion products in every product that is opened by the users.</li>
																<li>Eliminating process of entering account number on the payment process due to lowering the value of satisfaction.</li>
															</ol>

														</div>

														<div class="design">
															<h4>Design</h4>
															<p>The design of the wireframe created using Balsamiq applications based on sketches that I made earlier in the paper. Wireframe not made for all pages, only the page that change but still can describe UX flow of the registration process, login, search product, choose the product, buy products, and payment.</p>
															<img src="img/projects/tokopedia-wireframe.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

														</div>

														<div class="should">
															<h3>Potential for Development</h3>
															<p>
																The task execution is far from perfect. There are lot of shortcomings related to the process and methods used. Also there are many things that should be done so that the solution offered more relevant and reliable.
																<ol>
																	<li>The process should be done iteratively instead done with one iteration without further process.</li>
																	<li>Persona-making process and user needs must be based on valid supporting data not based on literature and observation.</li>
																	<li>Wireframe that has been created should be done usability testing to users to get feedback from them and fix it on the next iteration.</li>
																</ol>
															</p>
														</div>

														<h3>What I Learned</h3>
														<p>
																To solve problems in UX design, we can not rule out the role of users in every process including gathering the insights until designing the app that fit with what users needed through usability testing. In the design process, it's necessary to make user journey to identify user pain point at every step and give some opportunities to solve that pain. By the end of this project / challenge, I know how much fun doing what an UX designer do. I should be thinking about what the users think, it's just like I walked into user's minds.

																	User Interface of a mobile application is part of the design which combines various activity including arts, colors, logics, and analysis. It makes an UI designer a kind of magician who has to combine the elements of layout in such way that would make using the mobile app easy, clear, fast, and pleasant. So, no doubt, UI Designer has responsibility demands a lot of knowledge, inspirations, and research.
																	<br><br>
																	Today's challenge is all about shipment monitoring through mobile apps: it presents the UI concept for shipment monitoring of <a href="http://kargo.co.id" target="_blank">Kargo</a>.

														</div>

														<div class="">
															<h3>Task</h3>
															<p>
																Design the interface of shipment monitoring across Indonesia on an android device including delivery position, estimation time, and documents.
															</p>
														</div>

														<div class="proses">
															<h3>Process</h3>
															<p>The process starts from defining the product. The company needs a mobile-based app that can monitor its delivery across Indonesia. They want to know the position of the truck delivery, delivery status, estimated time, and documents related to the shipment.
																<br><br>
																The next process is defining the persona. Persona is defined as an android user who does not get high enough education and only understands Bahasa Indonesia. For that application will be designed to use Bahasa entirely.
																<br><br>
															</p>
																<img src="img/projects/kargo-persona.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="persona"><figcaption>User Persona</figcaption>
															<p>
																The process continues by doing wireframing on a piece of paper and forwarded to a high-level model using Photoshop. Wireframing with paper is selected because of short project time and it can speed up the process of collecting feedback from the user.
															</p>

															<img src="img/projects/kargo-wireframe.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="wireframe"><figcaption>Low Fidelity Wireframes</figcaption>
															<p>
																The first conception and stylistic decision for the design presented with the same color scheme with <a href="http://kargo.co.id" target="_blank">Kargo</a> website.
																I developed and designed 6 screens of different fungsionality:
																<ul>
																	<li>Navigation screen</li>
																	<li>List of shipment page</li>
																	<li>Shipment order page (pesanan)</li>
																	<li>Detail shipment page (detail)</li>
																	<li>Shipping position page (peta)</li>
																	<li>Document page (dokumen)</li>

																</ul>

															<p>
																The interface has three circles of different colors indicating the delivery status. Red indicating packing process, yellow indicating delivery process, and green indicating the items have been received by the customer.
																<br><br>
																Interesting to pay attention to the details of these circles. The green circle is made larger and the yellow circle is placed not in the middle but closer to the green to give a sense of optimism to the user that the goods they send will arrive soon to the customer.
																<br><br>
																Another interesting thing about the interface I designed is on the map page. Under the navigation bar, there is an animated truck that will move towards the green circle as the truck goes. The animation had purely functional goal dealing with the details of the navigation and user experience of fast, highly informative and enjoyable.

														<h3>What I Learned</h3>
														<p>
																To solve problems in UX design, we can not rule out the role of users in every process including gathering the insights until designing the app that fit with what users needed through usability testing. In the design process, it's necessary to make user journey to identify user pain point at every step and give some opportunities to solve that pain. By the end of this project / challenge, I know how much fun doing what an UX designer do. I should be thinking about what the users think, it's just like I walked into user's minds.

																	From May to August 2017, I did my summer internship as a UX Designer at P.T. Sanraya Adi Nataya or better known as <a href="http://goersapp.com" target="_blank">Goers</a>. Together with two intern developers, we were assigned to make offline ticketing system from scratch. This app is called Goers Offline Selling.
																</p>
															</div>
														</div>

														<div class="">
															<h3>Task</h3>
															<p>
																Design the interface and the experience of Goers Offline Selling, a web application that is able to facilitate ticket sales through agents so that ticket sales can be done offline. The purpose of offline sales here is that the sale of the tickets made by face to face between the buyer and the seller who in this case is the agent. Payment methods facilitated in offline sales are cash or credit and debit cards. It also provides sales summary of the number of tickets sold and total revenue during the ticketing period. In addition, Goers Offline Selling can also facilitate the seller to track back the ticket sales data if necessary.
															</p>
														</div>

														<div class="proses">
															<h3>Process</h3>
															<img src="img/projects/goers/process.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="proses"><br>
															<p>
																The design process starts from analysis for the functional needs. The analysis is done to find out what information and features the user needs related to offline ticket sales. The analysis process is done by doing research on three things, Goers business process, stakeholder interviews, and field survey.
																<br><br>
																Research on business processes on Goers application is useful to know the flow of Goers applications that already exist now. This is done so that Offline Selling application can run in harmony with existing aplication and in accordance with existing business process.
																<br><br>
																After conducting business process analysis and knowing what features will be implemented in Goers Offline Selling, further research on the needs of stakeholders through interviews is done. Research at this stage aims to make the application in accordance with the needs and desires of stakeholders. From the stakeholders also known who the users of this application.
																<br><br>
																The latest research was conducted by conducting a field survey of the offline ticket sales process. Field surveys are useful for knowing offline ticket sales flow and the barriers that occur during the ticket sales process.
																<br><br>
																These researchs process produces an information architecture that describes what pages will be implemented and what information is contained in each page and user flow to make the flow as optimal as possible to create a better user experience.

														<div class="Desain">
															<p>
																After knowing what pages should be there and also the flow of Goers Offline Selling, the next step is to design a wireframe. In the process of designing wireframe, used kakas making wireframe named Balsamiq. After the wireframe of a page has been completed, the wireframe is directly reviewed by Head of UI / UX to assess the composition of the content and its position if it is correct and appropriate. If the review process found there are things that are not appropriate then made a revision to be reviewed again until there is no shortage and ready to enter the design phase of the mockup.
															</p>
															<img src="img/projects/goers/wireframe.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="wireframe"><figcaption>Wireframes of Goers Offline Selling</figcaption>
															<p>
																After the wireframe design is approved by Head of UI / UX, then mockups are made for each page. Mockup is used as a reference display that will be implemented by the team of developers.
																<br><br>
																The mockup design is made by following the Goers design guideline. This guideline contains rules on the use of color, size and shape of various components, type and font size, as well as the design of every states used by Goers. By making this guideline as a reference design, it is expected the user more easily menggunakaan application Goers Offline Selling because it has been familiar with existing designs. Aside from the guideline, in designing the mockup, benchmarking of various other application designs to gain inspiration and insight into the design of good applications.
																<br><br>
																The mockup design process uses Adobe Illustrator. Just like wireframes, the finished mockup will be reviewed by Head of UI / UX whether it is in compliance with the guidelines and meets functional and non-functional requirements. If deemed not appropriate, then made a revision for later review.
																<br><br>
																<img src="img/projects/goers/prototype.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="prototype"><figcaption>Wireframes of Goers Offline Selling</figcaption>
															</p>
															<p>
																Mockup design results that have been reviewed and no revisions are then submitted to the team of developers using Zeplin's foot to be implemented.

														<h3>What I Learned</h3>
														<p>
															From this internship, I learned how the science I get in the classroom can be applied in a real company, not just a case study. I learned how business processes and stakeholders should be taken into account when designing interface of an application in an existing company.
															<br>
															I learned also that communicating design and interaction that designers want to developers is not easy and need super intense communication. A designer must be clever to communicate what he wants and must know whether his design is feasible to be implemented or not.
